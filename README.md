# Hellscape

## Installation:
1. Install cmake using a package manager or direct download: https://cmake.org/download/ (We'll be building the project from source!)
2. Git clone/download this repo (TODO: this might take a while as there are a lot of unbuilt libs...)
3. Make a folder _build_ in the root directory of HellScape.
4. Make folders _bullet3-build_ and _assimp-build_ in the _libs_ folder.
5. Run cmake on _bullet3_ (setting the build location to _bullet3-build_), and similarly for assimp
